**What was the goal of this project?**

1. To understand more about how to assign unique ids to a created element within a loop and set conditionals based on user action.

2. To refamiliarise myself with the 'setAttribute' and 'getAttribute' methods and how they can be used in conjunction with one another.

**What would I have done differently?** 

1. Create the image tags with the relevant data attributes within the markup and assign them a corresponding ID. This way, only the logic will be left behind within the 'index.js' file.
